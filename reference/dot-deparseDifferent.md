# Identify Differences Between Standard and New Objects but used in rxUiDeparse

This function compares elements of a standard object with a new object
and identifies which elements are different. It is used to only show
values that are different from the default when deparsing control
objects.

## Usage

``` r
.deparseDifferent(standard, new, internal = character(0))
```

## Arguments

- standard:

  The standard object used for comparison. (for example
  \`foceiControl()\`)

- new:

  The new object to be compared against the standard. This would be what
  the user supplide like \`foceiControl(outerOpt="bobyqa")\`

- internal:

  A character vector of element names to be ignored during the
  comparison. Default is an empty character vector. These are for
  internal items of the list that flag certain properties like if the
  \`rxControl()\` was generated by the \`foceiControl()\` procedure or
  not.

## Value

A vector of indices indicating which elements of the standard object
differ from the new object.
