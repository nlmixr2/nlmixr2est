# nlmixr2est 2.0.9

# New features

- What type(s) censoring (if any) is now stored in `fit$censInformation`

# Censoring fixes

 - Fixed bug where datasets with censoring that are not lower case `cens` and `limit` do not
   produce the correct table output (#180)

# nlmixr2est 2.0.8

## New features

- Add `pd`/`npd` as an output as well as `npd`/`npde`

## SAEM bug fix

- When loading a `nlmixr2` "saem" fit from another R session,
  `nlmixr2` will no longer crash with `fit$objf`

## NPDE/NPD fixes

- `NPDE` was identical to `NPD` even with correlated models, this was
  fixed (prior output was actually `NPDE`).

## Censoring fixes

- FOCEi censoring fixes:
  - M4 method equation bug fix
  - M4 method derivative change based on equation fix
  - M2 method added missing derivative 
  - Censoring already dTBS

- SAEM Censoring fixes:
  - SAEM method M4 method equation bug fix
  - Censoring limit changed to dTBS

- Censoring handling was unified

## Internal changes

- Added `ui$getSplitMuModel` which is used in `babelmixr2` and will be
  used in the refined stepwise covariate selection of `nlmixr2extra`

- Added work-around to remove `_nlmixr2est_RcppExport_registerCCallable`
  since the registering of C callable are handled manually at the moment.

# nlmixr2est 2.0.7

- Use `.zeros()` for the matrices in armadillo in addition to relying
  on `calloc` to give zero matrices.

- Fixed one uninitialized object

- Fix for `augPred` so it works on population only models

- `nlme` no longer sets options to treat all covariates as non
  mu-referenced covariates, but directly calls a function that can
  turn on or off the mu-reference covariate selection.

- `vpcSim` now tries to simulate IDs that didn't simulate correctly (with a warning)

- Export nmObjHandleControlObject

# nlmixr2est 2.0.6 -- new package

`nlmixr2est` contains the estimation functions within `nlmixr2`.

## FOCEI family changes

- Remove lower level `foceiFit` function.  Focei, foce, fo, foi, and
  posthoc now directly takes rxode2 ui objects

- New error types are supported in focei including mixing theta and
  etas in residual errors and different types of proportional errors

- Different types of additive and proportional errors can be used for
  each endpoint using ` + combined1()` or `+ combined2()` otherwise it
  takes the supplied `addProp` option to figure out which type of
  combined model is run (by default `combined2()`)

- Focei model cache is now named `focei-md5Digest.qs` and uses `qs`
  compression/saving/loading.

- `foceiControl()` aligned between other methods.

- `foceiControl(adjLik=TRUE)` uses the NONMEM-style objective function
  throughout.  `foceiControl(adjLik=FALSE)` uses the adjusted
  objective function throughout, and adjusts it back to the NONMEM
  objective function.

- Lag time and other between subject variability differences no longer
  calculate an ideal relative step size, but an absolute step size
  when using Gill differences (default)

- Objective function checks for infinite/NaN/NA values for the entire
  solving space and ensures no overflow occurs when calculating the
  inner hessian

## SAEM changes

- mu referencing is no longer required for `saem`; Internally non
  mu-referenced values are converted to mu referenced values and the
  converted back when calculating the nlmixr2 object.

- `nlmixr2` forced the parameter ordering to (1) population effects,
  (2) non mu-referenced between subject effects (3) omega estimates
  and (4) residual effects. This changes the order that `nlmixr2` sees
  the parameters. Since this is based on a random number generator,
  the optimization trajectory will be different and have different
  results than `nlmixr`

- Components of `omega` can now be fixed.

- Residual error components can also be fixed.

- When optimizing only one residual value, nlmixr2's saem uses `nlm`
  from R, which is more efficient than the nealder-meade method.

- Lower level `saem` functions (like `configsaem()`) are not exported
  because they are increasingly difficult to use and convert to
  something standard; a few methods (like `print`, `summary` etc) are
  maintained to view the lower level object and for debugging it.

- Parameter history and print-out no longer includes fixed parameters.

- The model to calculate the residuals more closely matches the model
  used for estimation to remove small rounding differences that may
  occur in the models.

- Different types of additive and proportional errors can be used for
  each endpoint using ` + combined1()` or `+ combined2()` otherwise it
  takes the supplied `addProp` option to figure out which type of
  combined model is run (by default `combined2()`)

- Parameter history and printout now uses standard deviation for
  additive only components, matching the estimation of the components.

- `rxode2` solving options are now saved in the `rxControl` part of
  the `saemControl()`.  That is
  `saemControl(rxControl=rxControl(...))`; This fixes any conflicting
  option names as well as allowing alignment between the control
  structures in `focei`, `nlme` and `saem`

- `saemControl()` aligned between other methods.


## nlme changes

- `nlme` has been completely rewritten to directly run from the
  `rxode2` UI

- `nlme` always tries to use mu-referencing (when available)

- Internally `nlme` now uses parallel processing for solving so it
  should be faster.

- `nlmixr2NlmeControl()` (which will overwrite `nlmeControl()`)
  documents and adds more options to `nlme`. Also aligned with other
  methods.

- `weights`, `fixed`, `random` can be specified in
  `nlmixr2NlmeControl()`.  If so, then the `nlme` object will be
  returned.

- `returnNlme` is a new option that will return the `nlme` object
  instead of the traditional `nlme` object.

- `nlme_ode` and `lme_lin_cmpt` are both removed.

- `rxode2` solving options are now saved in the `rxControl` part of
  the `saemControl()`.  That is
  `nlmeControl(rxControl=rxControl(...))`; This fixes any conflicting
  option names as well as allowing alignment between the control
  structures in `focei`, `nlme` and `saem`

## nlmixr2 object change

- With `saem`, the nlmixr2 function now saves/compresses the `phiM`
  information.  This means the gaussian and laplacian likelihoods can
  be calculated when you save the nlmixr object and then restore it
  later.

- The nlmixr2 object compresses infrequently used and removes many
  unneeded objects. Even with compression, the `saem` objects are
  often a bit bigger since they include the large `phiM` object.

- `nlmixr2` now supports non-mu referenced ETAs in the `fit$parFixed`
  and `fit$parFixedDf`

## nlmixr2 interface change

- `nlmixr2` interface changed to use `rxode2` UI

- `keep` and `drop` are added to `tableControl` to influence the end data-frame

- `$simInfo` uses a quoted expression for `$rx` instead of a string

- `$simInfo$sigma` is a diagonal matrix since now the normal
  simulation is controlled by the variability modeled as a population
  value.

- `nlmixr2` now allows etas that have initial omega estimates of zero
  to be dropped from the model (instead of issuing an error about a
  non-positive definite `$omega` matrix)

## NPDE changes

- Fixed a bug where the number of simulations for a NPDE calculation
  are correctly passed by `addNpde(fit, table=tableControl(nsim=500))`

## VPC changes

- `vpc` function rewritten and split out to `vpcSim()` and
  `vpcPlot()` (which is a replacement for `vpc()`).

- There were too many mismatches between `vpc::vpc` and `nlmixr::vpc`
  which caused inconsistencies in code based on load order of `vpc`
  and `nlmixr`.  This way both coexist, and you can use the `vpc`
  simulation for other packages more easily (like `ggPMX`) without
  creating or summarizing data since `ggPMX` has its own methods for
  summarizing and creating plots.

- VPC now directly uses `rxode2::rxSolve`

## augPred() changes

- `augPred()` has been written to use the new fit object.

- `nlmixr2AugPred` was changed to `nlmixr2AugPredSolve()`

- `augPred` uses the new interface and supports multiple endpoints.
  The endpoint name is now always on the `plot(augPred(fit))`.

## getFitMethod() change

- Internally, fit estimation method is saved in `fit$est`, and now
  `getFitMethod(fit)` simply returns `fit$est`

## Delete methods

- Many methods lower level utility functions have been deleted.

- `nmDocx`, `nmLst` and `nmSave` have been removed.

## Bug fixes

- Now will reset the cache when items cannot be loaded. In the past
  error messages like `function
  'rx_0ba247452048de33b1ffb8af516714fc__calc_lhs' not provided by
  package 'rx_0ba247452048de33b1ffb8af516714fc_'` would cause the
  estimation to stop.  Now `rxode2::rxClean()` is run when this occurs.

# nlmixr 2.0.6

- Fix `focei` subject initialization, see #566

# nlmixr 2.0.5

- Fix for `nlmixrSim` CMT to have a factor that matches the `RxODE`
  definition (issue #501)

- Give instructions on how to reinstall nlmixr if it is linked to a
  different version of `RxODE`. (#555)

- Now inform which parameters are near the boundary (#544)

- The `saem` estimation routine will now increase the tolerance when
  ODE solving is difficult; This can be controlled with
  `odeRecalcFactors` and `maxOdeRecalc`.  This is similar to the
  handling that `focei` already uses.

- For `focei` family estimation methods:

  - If the inner problem couldn't solve the ODE using the forward
    sensitivities, try using numerical differences to approximate the
    derivatives needed for the focei problem.  A warning will be
    issued when this occurs. This requires RxODE 1.1.0 that always
    generates the finite difference prediction model. If RxODE is an
    earlier version, only apply this when the finite differences are
    supplied to nlmixr.  This occurs when there are ETAs on the dose
    based events like duration, lag time, bioavailability etc.

  - If eta nudge is non-zero, when resetting an ETA estimate, try the
    zero estimate first, and then the nudged locations.

  - When there is an ODE system for an individual that cannot be
    optimized in the inner problem, adjust that individual's objective
    function by 100 points.  This can be controlled by
    `foceiControl(badSolveObjfAdj=100)`

  - Theta reset now will now make sure the parameter is estimated and
    between the proper bounds before resetting.

 - `$simInfo` non longer tries to generate the covariance step, and
   will simply have a `$simInfo$thetaMat` entry of `NULL` if the
   covariance step was unsuccessful.

 - With `vpc()` if the cmt conversion isn't working correctly, fall
   back to compartment numbers.

 - Take out symbol stripping based on CRAN policies

 - Fall back gracefully when `rbind` doesn't work in parameter
   histories.

 - Correctly print out the number of compartments based on the new
   `RxODE` `linCmt()` that was updated to support solved systems in
   focei. (Reported by Bill Denney #537).

 - Use strict headers since Rcpp now is moving toward strict headers.
   Also changed all the `Calloc` to `R_Calloc`, `Free` to `R_Free`,
   and `DOUBLE_EPS` to `DBL_EPSILON`.

- `gnlmm` no longer imports the data.frame to an RxODE event table.
  This should speed up the routine slightly and (more importantly)
  make it easier to specify time varying covariates.


# nlmixr 2.0.4

- Now can use the following for combined error models:
  `foceiControl(addProp=1)` `foceiControl(addProp=2)`
  `saemControl(addProp=1)` `saemControl(addProp=2)`

- Bug-fix for SAEM add+prop and other error models that are optimized
  with nelder mead simplex (#503)

- Bug-fix for more complex SAEM models that were not parsing and running. (Issue
  #502, #501)

- Issue the "NaN in prediction" once per SAEM problem (#500)

# nlmixr 2.0.3

## User interface changes
 - Detection of initial conditions was rewritten to enable additional features
   in the initial conditions (#322). The most important user-facing change is
   that now arbitrary R expressions can be used when setting initial conditions
   such as `tvCL <- log(c(2,3,4))` (#253) instead of simply `tvCL <- log(3)`

 - The function as.nlmixrBounds() now supports adding the columns that are
   missing into the input data.frame.

 - omega definitions can be correlation matrices (#338)

 - Can specify `keep=` and `drop=` in the nlmixr function to keep and
   drop columns in nlmixr output.  Can also specify
   `control=list(keep=,drop=)` or `nlmixr(...,keep=,drop=)` to
   keep/drop columns (#260)

## `focei` changes:
 - Uses RxODE to re-arrange the problem so it does not include
   `if/else` in the model (ie. un-branched code). This allows
   sensitivities to be calculated in one pass saving time for multiple
   endpoint models and models with `if/else` in them.

- `linCmt()` now uses solved systems instead of translating to ODEs.
  - Uses `RxODE`/`stan`'s math headers to calculate the sensitivities
    of the super-positioned `linCmt()` solutions.
  - This uses the `advan` solutions and hence supports
    support time-varying covariates.

- `focei` now supports censoring in the same way `monolix` does, with
  `cens` and `limit` columns

- `focei` now allows `eta`s on dose-related modeled events like
  `alag`, `f`, etc by finite difference sensitivities.

- `focei` now supports 2 combined additive + proportional error
  models;
  - `combined1`: `trans(y) = trans(f) + (a+b*f^c)*err`
  - `combined2`: `trans(y) = trans(f) + sqrt(a^2+b^2*f^(2c))*err`

- `focei` `etaNudge` parameters were changed to use quadrature points
  covering 95% percent of a standard normal.

- With zero gradients, Gill differences are recomputed to try to find
  a non-zero gradient.

- Now when running if a zero gradient is detected, reset the problem
  (theta reset) and re-estimated with `outerOpt="bobyqa"`

- Now when running a model where the last objective function is not
  the minimum objective function, issue a warning and skip the
  covariance step. (See Issue #403)

- `focei` proportional and power models are more tolerant of 0
  predictions in your data


## SAEM changes

 - `saem` fits now gracefully fall back to the `focei` likelihood when
   they support files are no longer on the loaded disk

 - `saem` phi pile is now saved in the `RxODE::rxTempDir()` which can
   be customized to allow the `phi` file to remain after R has exited

 - `saem` fits now can add in `fo`, `foce` and `focei` likelihood

 - `saem` fits now use `liblsoda` by default and are multi-threaded when
   running (controlled by `RxODE`)

 - `saem` now supports time-varying covariates (like clock-time)

 - `saem` now supports 2 combined additive + proportional error models:
    - `combined1`: `trans(y) = trans(f) + (a+b*f^c)*err`
	- `combined2`: `trans(y) = trans(f) + sqrt(a^2+b^2*f^(2c))*err`

 - `saem` proportional and power models are more tolerant of 0
    predictions in your data

 - `saem` now supports censoring a similar way as `monolix` does, with
  `cens` and `limit` columns

 - The default of `saem` additive + proportional error has been
   switched to `combined2`, which was the `focei` default, but you can
   change this back with `saemControl(addProp="combined2")`.  The
   table results will likely be different because in the last release
   the `saem` calculated `combined1` and then used these coefficients
   in the `combined2` focei problem.

## nlme changes

- `nlme` will now support 2 combined additive + proportional error models (if the patched version of nlme is used)
    - `combined1`: `y = f + (a+b*f)*err`
	- `combined2`: `y = f + sqrt(a^2+b^2*f^2)*err`
	- See https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/issues/428
	- Thanks to Johannes Ranke (@jranke) for the nlme patch and the catch

- Can switch with `nlmeControl(addProp="combined1")` to use the combined1 type of error model

## New Utilities

 - `bootstrapFit` now calculates the bootstrap confidence bands and
   (optionally) will compare with the theoretical chi-squared
   distribution to help assess their adequacy.

 - `covarSearchAuto` now allows automatic forward/backward covariate
   selection

## General Changes

 - Added auto-completion of `nlmixr` object properties accessed by
   `$`. This works for major editors including `Rstudio`, `ESS`, and
   Base R itself.

 - Changed the way that Rstudio notebooks display `nlmixr` objects; It
   should be more legible in Rstudio.

 - Graphics have been revamped to show censoring (including adding
   ggplot stat/geom `geom_cens`) as well as use `RxODE`'s ggplot theme
   (`rxTheme()`).  Additionally time after dose is calculated as `tad`
   for all `nlmixr` models

 - Tables generation has been refactored; `npde` uses the `arma` and
   `RxODE` random number generators which may change results.  Also
   the default of `ties=TRUE` has been changed to `ties=FALSE`.
   `npde` calculations have been threaded with `OpenMP` to speed up
   the calculation as well.  This refactoring was required to have the
   `dv` imputation between `cwres` and `npde` use the same method.
   The `npde` option now calculates the decorrelated `npd` as well, (which is
   the recommended weighted residual; see Nguyen 2017)

## Bug Fixes

 - Aligned `saem` and `focei` additive + proportional error models, so
   `saem` `additive+proportional` outputs will be different using the
   correct `focei` method

Note this includes all the RxODE changes *including* dropping python.
