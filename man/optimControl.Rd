\arguments{
\item{method}{The method to be used. See \sQuote{Details}.  Can be abbreviated.}

\item{trace}{Non-negative integer. If positive, tracing information
on the progress of the optimization is produced. Higher values
may produce more tracing information: for method `"L-BFGS-B"`,
there are six levels of tracing. See `optim()` for more
information}

\item{fnscale}{An overall scaling to be applied to the value of `fn`
and `gr` during optimization. If negative, turns the problem
into a maximization problem. Optimization is performed on
`fn(par)/fnscale`}

\item{parscale}{A vector of scaling values for the parameters.
Optimization is performed on `par/parscale` and these should be
comparable in the sense that a unit change in any element
produces about a unit change in the scaled value.  Not used (nor
needed) for `method = "Brent"`}

\item{ndeps}{A vector of step sizes for the finite-difference
approximation to the gradient, on `par/parscale` scale.  Defaults
to `1e-3`}

\item{maxit}{The maximum number of iterations. Defaults to `100`
for the derivative-based methods, and `500` for `"Nelder-Mead"`.}

\item{abstol}{The absolute convergence tolerance. Only useful for
non-negative functions, as a tolerance for reaching zero.}

\item{reltol}{Relative convergence tolerance.  The algorithm stops
if it is unable to reduce the value by a factor of `reltol *
(abs(val) + reltol)` at a step}

\item{alpha}{Reflection factor for the `"Nelder-Mead"` method.}

\item{beta}{Contraction factor for the `"Nelder-Mead"` method}

\item{gamma}{Expansion  factor for the `"Nelder-Mead"` method}

\item{REPORT}{The frequency of reports for the `"BFGS"`,
`"L-BFGS-B"` and `"SANN"` methods if `control$trace` is
positive. Defaults to every 10 iterations for `"BFGS"` and
`"L-BFGS-B"`, or every 100 temperatures for `"SANN"`}

\item{warn.1d.NelderMead}{a logical indicating if the (default)
`"Nelder-Mead"` method should signal a warning when used for
one-dimensional minimization.  As the warning is sometimes
inappropriate, you can suppress it by setting this option to
`FALSE`}

\item{type}{for the conjugate-gradients method.  Takes value `1`
for the Fletcher-Reeves update, `2` for Polak-Ribiere and `3` for
Beale-Sorenson.}

\item{lmm}{is an integer giving the number of BFGS updates retained
in the `"L-BFGS-B"` method, It defaults to `5`}

\item{factr}{controls the convergence of the `"L-BFGS-B"` method.
Convergence occurs when the reduction in the objective is within
this factor of the machine tolerance. Default is `1e7`, that is a
tolerance of about `1e-8`.}

\item{pgtol}{helps control the convergence of the ‘"L-BFGS-B"’
method.  It is a tolerance on the projected gradient in the
current search direction. This defaults to zero, when the check
is suppressed}

\item{temp}{controls the `"SANN"` method. It is the starting
temperature for the cooling schedule. Defaults to `10`.}

\item{tmax}{is the number of function evaluations at each
temperature for the `"SANN"` method. Defaults to `10`.}

\item{stickyRecalcN}{The number of bad ODE solves before reducing
the atol/rtol for the rest of the problem.}

\item{maxOdeRecalc}{Maximum number of times to reduce the ODE
tolerances and try to resolve the system if there was a bad
ODE solve.}

\item{odeRecalcFactor}{The ODE recalculation factor when ODE
solving goes bad, this is the factor the rtol/atol is reduced}

\item{eventType}{Event gradient type for dosing events; Can be
"central" or "forward"}

\item{shiErr}{This represents the epsilon when optimizing the ideal
step size for numeric differentiation using the Shi2021 method}

\item{shi21maxFD}{The maximum number of steps for the optimization
of the forward difference step size when using dosing events (lag
time, modeled duration/rate and bioavailability)}

\item{solveType}{tells if `optim` will use nlmixr2's analytical
  gradients when available (finite differences will be used for
  event-related parameters like parameters controlling lag time,
  duration/rate of infusion, and modeled bioavailability). This can
  be:

- `"gradient"` which will use the gradient and let `optim` calculate
   the finite difference hessian

- `"fun"` where optim will calculate both the finite difference
   gradient and the finite difference Hessian

 When using nlmixr2's finite differences, the "ideal" step size for
 either central or forward differences are optimized for with the
 Shi2021 method which may give more accurate derivatives

These are only applied in the gradient based methods: "BFGS", "CG",
"L-BFGS-B"}

\item{useColor}{Boolean indicating if focei can use ASCII color codes}

\item{printNcol}{Number of columns to printout before wrapping
parameter estimates/gradient}

\item{print}{Integer representing when the outer step is
printed. When this is 0 or do not print the iterations.  1 is
print every function evaluation (default), 5 is print every 5
evaluations.}

\item{normType}{This is the type of parameter
    normalization/scaling used to get the scaled initial values
    for nlmixr2.  These are used with \code{scaleType} of.

    With the exception of \code{rescale2}, these come
    from
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling}{Feature
    Scaling}. The \code{rescale2} The rescaling is the same type
    described in the
    \href{http://apmonitor.com/me575/uploads/Main/optimization_book.pdf}{OptdesX}
    software manual.

    In general, all all scaling formula can be described by:

    \deqn{v_{scaled}}{Vscaled} = (\deqn{v_{unscaled}-C_{1}}{Vunscaled-C1})/\deqn{C_{2}}{C2}


    Where


    The other data normalization approaches follow the following formula

    \deqn{v_{scaled}}{Vscaled} = (\deqn{v_{unscaled}-C_{1}}{Vunscaled-C1})/\deqn{C_{2}}{C2}

\itemize{

\item \code{rescale2} This scales all parameters from (-1 to 1).
    The relative differences between the parameters are preserved
    with this approach and the constants are:

    \deqn{C_{1}}{C1} = (max(all unscaled values)+min(all unscaled values))/2

    \deqn{C_{2}}{C2} = (max(all unscaled values) - min(all unscaled values))/2


\item \code{rescale} or min-max normalization. This rescales all
    parameters from (0 to 1).  As in the \code{rescale2} the
    relative differences are preserved.  In this approach:

    \deqn{C_{1}}{C1} = min(all unscaled values)

    \deqn{C_{2}}{C2} = max(all unscaled values) - min(all unscaled values)


\item \code{mean} or mean normalization.  This rescales to center
    the parameters around the mean but the parameters are from 0
    to 1.  In this approach:

    \deqn{C_{1}}{C1} = mean(all unscaled values)

    \deqn{C_{2}}{C2} = max(all unscaled values) - min(all unscaled values)

\item \code{std} or standardization.  This standardizes by the mean
     and standard deviation.  In this approach:

    \deqn{C_{1}}{C1} = mean(all unscaled values)

    \deqn{C_{2}}{C2} = sd(all unscaled values)

\item \code{len} or unit length scaling.  This scales the
   parameters to the unit length.  For this approach we use the Euclidean length, that
   is:

    \deqn{C_{1}}{C1} = 0

    \deqn{C_{2}}{C2} = \deqn{\sqrt(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2)}{sqrt(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2)}


\item \code{constant} which does not perform data normalization. That is

    \deqn{C_{1}}{C1} = 0

    \deqn{C_{2}}{C2} = 1

}}

\item{scaleType}{The scaling scheme for nlmixr2.  The supported types are:

\itemize{
\item \code{nlmixr2}  In this approach the scaling is performed by the following equation:

   \deqn{v_{scaled}}{Vscaled} = (\deqn{v_{current} - v_{init}}{Vcurrent - Vinit})*scaleC[i] + scaleTo

The \code{scaleTo} parameter is specified by the \code{normType},
and the scales are specified by \code{scaleC}.

\item \code{norm} This approach uses the simple scaling provided
    by the \code{normType} argument.

\item \code{mult} This approach does not use the data
normalization provided by \code{normType}, but rather uses
multiplicative scaling to a constant provided by the \code{scaleTo}
argument.

  In this case:

  \deqn{v_{scaled}}{Vscaled} = \deqn{v_{current}}{Vcurrent}/\deqn{v_{init}}{Vinit}*scaleTo

\item \code{multAdd} This approach changes the scaling based on
the parameter being specified.  If a parameter is defined in an
exponential block (ie exp(theta)), then it is scaled on a
linearly, that is:

  \deqn{v_{scaled}}{Vscaled} = (\deqn{v_{current}-v_{init}}{Vcurrent-Vinit}) + scaleTo

Otherwise the parameter is scaled multiplicatively.

   \deqn{v_{scaled}}{Vscaled} = \deqn{v_{current}}{Vcurrent}/\deqn{v_{init}}{Vinit}*scaleTo

}}

\item{scaleCmax}{Maximum value of the scaleC to prevent overflow.}

\item{scaleCmin}{Minimum value of the scaleC to prevent underflow.}

\item{scaleC}{The scaling constant used with
    \code{scaleType=nlmixr2}.  When not specified, it is based on
    the type of parameter that is estimated.  The idea is to keep
    the derivatives similar on a log scale to have similar
    gradient sizes.  Hence parameters like log(exp(theta)) would
    have a scaling factor of 1 and log(theta) would have a scaling
    factor of ini_value (to scale by 1/value; ie
    d/dt(log(ini_value)) = 1/ini_value or scaleC=ini_value)

   \itemize{

   \item For parameters in an exponential (ie exp(theta)) or
   parameters specifying powers, boxCox or yeoJohnson
   transformations , this is 1.

   \item For additive, proportional, lognormal error structures,
   these are given by 0.5*abs(initial_estimate)

   \item Factorials are scaled by abs(1/digamma(initial_estimate+1))

   \item parameters in a log scale (ie log(theta)) are transformed
   by log(abs(initial_estimate))*abs(initial_estimate)

   }

   These parameter scaling coefficients are chose to try to keep
   similar slopes among parameters.  That is they all follow the
   slopes approximately on a log-scale.

   While these are chosen in a logical manner, they may not always
   apply.  You can specify each parameters scaling factor by this
   parameter if you wish.}

\item{scaleTo}{Scale the initial parameter estimate to this value.
By default this is 1.  When zero or below, no scaling is performed.}

\item{gradTo}{this is the factor that the gradient is scaled to
before optimizing.  This only works with
scaleType="nlmixr2".}

\item{rxControl}{`rxode2` ODE solving options during fitting, created with `rxControl()`}

\item{optExpression}{Optimize the rxode2 expression to speed up
calculation. By default this is turned on.}

\item{sumProd}{Is a boolean indicating if the model should change
multiplication to high precision multiplication and sums to
high precision sums using the PreciseSums package.  By default
this is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{literalFix}{boolean, substitute fixed population values as
literals and re-adjust ui and parameter estimates after
optimization; Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{literalFixRes}{boolean, substitute fixed population values as
literals and re-adjust ui and parameter estimates after
optimization; Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{returnOptim}{logical; when TRUE this will return the optim
list instead of the nlmixr2 fit object}

\item{addProp}{specifies the type of additive plus proportional
  errors, the one where standard deviations add (combined1) or the
  type where the variances add (combined2).

The combined1 error type can be described by the following equation:

  \deqn{y = f + (a + b\times f^c) \times \varepsilon}{y = f + (a + b*f^c)*err}

The combined2 error model can be described by the following equation:

 \deqn{y = f + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2\times f^{2\times c}} \times \varepsilon}{y = f + sqrt(a^2 + b^2*(f^c)^2)*err}

 Where:

 - y represents the observed value

 - f represents the predicted value

 - a  is the additive standard deviation

 - b is the proportional/power standard deviation

 - c is the power exponent (in the proportional case c=1)}

\item{calcTables}{This boolean is to determine if the foceiFit
will calculate tables. By default this is \code{TRUE}}

\item{compress}{Should the object have compressed items}

\item{covMethod}{allows selection of "r", which uses nlmixr2's
`nlmixr2Hess()` for the hessian calculation or "optim" which uses
the hessian from `stats::optim(.., hessian=TRUE)`}

\item{adjObf}{is a boolean to indicate if the objective function
should be adjusted to be closer to NONMEM's default objective
function.  By default this is \code{TRUE}}

\item{ci}{Confidence level for some tables.  By default this is
0.95 or 95\% confidence.}

\item{sigdig}{Optimization significant digits. This controls:

\itemize{

 \item The tolerance of the inner and outer optimization is \code{10^-sigdig}

 \item The tolerance of the ODE solvers is
 \code{0.5*10^(-sigdig-2)}; For the sensitivity equations and
 steady-state solutions the default is \code{0.5*10^(-sigdig-1.5)}
 (sensitivity changes only applicable for liblsoda)

 \item The tolerance of the boundary check is \code{5 * 10 ^ (-sigdig + 1)}

}}

\item{sigdigTable}{Significant digits in the final output table.
If not specified, then it matches the significant digits in the
`sigdig` optimization algorithm.  If `sigdig` is NULL, use 3.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to \code{fn} and \code{gr}.}
